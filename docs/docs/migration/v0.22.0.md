# Upgrading a blockchain to use Ignite CLI v0.22.0

1. Open your `go.mod` and change the Ignite CLI line with `github.com/ignite/cli v0.22.0`

2. Upgrade your IBC version to [v3](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v3.0.0).

    1. Search for `github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v2` in the import statements of your `.go` files and replace `v2` in the end with `v3`

    1. Open your `app.go`,

        - Update your transfer keeper by adding another `app.IBCKeeper.ChannelKeeper` as an argument after `app.IBCKeeper.ChannelKeeper`

        - Define `var transferIBCModule = transfer.NewIBCModule(app.TransferKeeper)` in your `New()` func, and update your existent IBC router to use it: `ibcRouter.AddRoute(ibctransfertypes.ModuleName, transferIBCModule)` 

    3. Open your `go.mod` and change the IBC line with `github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v3 v3.0.0`
